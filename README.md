# 3d-ewald-summation
Validation of 3D_Ewald Summation for water molecules including Energy, Forces and Virial

This code is a non optimized implementation of the ewald summation code for 3d periodic system,using the equations from Essmann et al. paper. So far, I could match the Energies but couldnt match force and virial with gromacs.

I could also get Trace (virial) = E_coul * V correctly.

Created a separate folder for testing and validation results

All equations used here are kept in http://ydsumith.weebly.com/equations-706485.html
