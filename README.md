Validation of 3D_Ewald Summation for water molecules including Energy, Forces and Virial

I have tried to implement the ewald summation code for 3d periodic system,using the equations from Essmann et al. paper. I could match the Energies but couldnt match force and virial with gromacs.

I could also get Trace (virial) = E_coul * V correctly.

Anyone can point out the missing details?
Created a separate folder for testing and validation results
